https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/03/10/
this one is hard
use promise.el instead
* DONE pretty print the dom 
travese the dom tree and print the code part in side done

org template and find the code type to highlight
each will have tag use the tag 

* DONE next and previous link
local buffer var
no, just a global state is ok 
because you will have a singleton *How Dou You* buffer
* DONE insert link also
done
#+begin_example

#+end_example
* DONE parse link and retain img
query ubuntu disk partition

done but not good
now the lines are long and double white spaces

how about modify the dom directly
* DONE dom is just a tree 
walk this dom and if it's an a tag, replace it* dom is just a tree 

(pre nil (code nil int x; x = 10;))
* DONE manipulate dom all in one
to drop the insert example org
* DONE print 3 answers and scores
* DONE show only first answer, collapse other
* DONE better error handle

* DONE image inside a tag should be ignore
* DONE include question title

* DONE packaging
* DONE user agent
test url
https://www.google.com/search?q=curl%20 what ever

working with user agent:
curl -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0" https://www.google.com/search?q=curl

without, die
curl 'https://www.google.com/search?q=curl'

when you call withou user agent google will show different pages to you, 
the trick (dom-by-class dom "jfp3ef") will only work on this case.

because of this it can figure out you're not using a browser and ban you later

* DONE use curl 
directly use of curl is hard, use request which is an abtraction over curl

eval triggered:

catch the error: (wrong-type-argument symbolp 
(get-buffer name)

Return the buffer named name (a string).
If there is no live buffer named name, return nil.
name may also be a buffer; if so, the value is that buffer.

(get-buffer-create name)

Return the buffer named name, or create such a buffer and return it.
A new buffer is created if there is no live buffer named name.
If name starts with a space, the new buffer does not keep undo information.
If name is a buffer instead of a string, then it is the value returned.
The value is never nil.

probably when code sections look like lisp code

#+begin_src 
(pre nil #+begin_example  emacs 
 ((code nil (if (buffer-exists "my-buffer-name")
    ; do something
 )
))

(pre nil #+begin_example  emacs 
 (code nil (if (buffer-exists "my-buffer-name")
    ; do something
 )
) #+end_example)
#+end_src

bug was due to returning double pathenthese which shr-insert-document will complain
#+begin_example
`(pre nil "#+begin_example " ,howdoyou--current-lang "\n" ,(nthcdr 2 it) "\n#+end_example"))
=> (pre nil #begin... ((code nil ...)) #end..)

if class is lang use lang

imposible because the class attribute is added later by js

* DONE on fisrt opening, text line is not wrapped 
maybe pop buffer first so it has a size move pop-to-buffers won't solve this but
make the buffer wrapped not in window but a full with window (or full screen?)

* DONE how about pop window showing "getting ..." then fill it later just like what we did 
in javascript

* DONE window selection should be predictable
- if *hdy* buffer window is currently select. Then use it 
- it not then create new window other than the current one if there is only one window.

get hdy buffer, get window having buffer, if window is seleted use it, otherwise use other window

      (display-buffer howdoi-buffer '(display-buffer-use-some-window (inhibit-same-window . t))))
* DONE links conflict with line breaks
links in org mode are longer so shr line breaks will be not correct

on shr when iterate, if see a convertable links
give out
#+begin_example
[[ ttt ][index]]
[[ ttt ][0]]
[[ ttt ][1]]
#+end_example
and put the links in a index variable
then another function will run through the buffer and do a search and replace
it's possible but too much of work and make the code fragile

how about shr width is infinitive and 
turn on visual line mode and your buffer will be responsive, this is the right way 
* DONE bug: catch the error: (error Memory exhausted--use C-x s then exit and restart Emacs)
query: posgresql upsert
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17267417/how-to-upsert-merge-insert-on-duplicate-update-in-postgresql

something with shr-insert-document
when no bindings it works

(defun howdoyou--print-node (dom)
  (shr-insert-document dom))

with shadow bindings it crashes

(defun howdoyou--print-node (dom)
  "Print the DOM."
  ;; shawdow some `shr' parameters
  (let ((shr-bullet "- ") ;; insead of *
        (shr-width most-positive-fixnum) ;; no more line breaks
        (shr-use-fonts nil)) ;; so shr-internal-width is correct on first run
    (shr-insert-document dom)))

that would be the parsing with code     

no shr-insert-document crashes

(shr-width most-positive-fixnum)

no it's shr-use-fonts nil
(let ((shr-bullet "- ") (shr-width most-positive-fixnum) (shr-use-fonts nil)) (shr-insert-document thanh))
Eval error ***  Memory exhausted--use C-x s then exit and restart Emacs
when both of them combined

set shr-width to 0 or negative will disable line breaks in a sure way

(defun shr-fill-lines (start end)
  (if (<= shr-internal-width 0)
* reponse to review

#+begin_quote
These look like false positives. You can (and should) silence the compiler so
that the warnings don't confuse users installing the package -- one way would be
to rewrite the function body as:

  (let* ((answer-nodes (dom-by-class (cdr result) "answercell"))
         (question-dom (car (dom-by-id (cdr result) "^question$")))
         (title (car (dom-by-class (cdr result) "question-hyperlink")))
         (number-of-answers (min (length answer-nodes) howdoyou-number-of-answers))
         (tags (howdoyou--get-so-tags (cdr result)))
         (score-nodes (dom-by-class (cdr result) "js-vote-count"))
         acc
         scores)
    (dotimes (i number-of-answers)
      (setq acc (append acc (dom-by-class (nth i answer-nodes) "post-text"))))
    (dotimes (i (1+ number-of-answers))
      (setq scores (append scores `(,(dom-text (nth i score-nodes))))))
    (list (car result)
          (dom-text title)
          (dom-by-class question-dom "post-text")
          acc
          scores
          tags)))

but the function feels more complicated than it needs to be.
#+end_quote
This won't work

#+begin_quote
You should (require 'subr-x) for if-let (rather than rely on transitive imports). Similarly you should (require 'url-http),
#+end_quote
This i don't understand

#+begin_quote
And some minor stuff:

    howdoyou.el#L198: Consider unless ... instead of when (not ...)
    howdoyou.el#L21: Prefer https over http (if possible)

#+end_quote
thanks, corrected

    #+begin_quote
    Try to be precise with your indentation, e.g. here, since it can obfuscate
    the scope of your expressions. (Emacs should be able to indent elisp code
    consistently.)
    #+end_quote
This is wrong.
